             To the left, to the left 
             To the left, to the left, mmm 

             To the left, to the left 
             Everything you own in the box to the left
             In the closet, that's my stuff, yes
             If I bought it, please, don't touch
             And keep talking that mess, that's fine
             But could you walk and talk at the same time?
             And it's my name that's on that Jag
             So remove your bags, let me call you a cab
             
             Standing in the front yard
             Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
             Talkin' 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
             You got me twisted
             
             You must not know about me
             You must not know about me
             I could have another you in a minute
             Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
             You must not know about me
             You must not know about me
             I can have another you by tomorrow
             So don't you ever for one second get to thinking
             You're irreplaceable
             
             So go ahead and get gone
             Call up that chick and see if she's home
             Oops, I bet you thought that I didn't know
             What did you think I was putting you out for?
             Because you was untrue
             Rollin' her around in the car that I bought you
             Baby, drop them keys
             Hurry up before your taxi leaves
             
             Standing in the front yard
             Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
             Talkin' 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
             You got me twisted
             
             You must not know about me
             You must not know about me
             I could have another you in a minute

             You must not know about me
             You must not know about me
             I will have another you by tomorrow
             So don't you ever for one second get to thinking
             You're irreplaceable
             
             So since I'm not your everything
             How about I'll be your nothing?
             Nothing at all to you
             Baby, I won't shed a tear for you
             I won't lose a wink of sleep
             'Cause the truth of the matter is
             Replacing you is so easy
             
             To the left, to the left
             To the left, to the left, mmm
             To the left, to the left
             Everything you own in the box to the left
             To the left, to the left
             Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
             You're irreplaceable
             
             You must not know about me
             You must not know about me
             I could have another you in a minute
             Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
             You must not know about me
             You must not know about me
             I can have another you by tomorrow
             So don't you ever for one second get to thinking, baby
             
             You must not know about me
             You must not know about me
             I could have another you in a minute
             Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute
             Nigga, pack all your bags, we're finished
             (You must not know about me)
             'Cause you made your bed, now lay in it
             (You must not know about me)
             I can have another you by tomorrow
             Don't you ever for one second get to thinking

                Just shout whenever (yo), and I'll be there (uh-huh)
                You are my love (yo), you are my heart (uh-huh)
                And we will never, ever, ever be apart (yo, uh-huh)
                Are we an item? (Yo) girl, quit playin' (uh-huh)
                "We're just friends" (yo), what are you sayin'? (Uh-huh)
                Said, "There's another" (yo), and looked right in my eyes (uh-huh)
                My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like (yo, uh-huh)
                "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
                Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"
                Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
                I thought you'd always be mine, mine
                "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
                Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"
                Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"

                I'm goin' down (oh), down, down, down (uh-huh)
                And I just can't believe, my first love won't be around, and I'm like
                "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
                Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"

                Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
                I thought you'd always be mine, mine (Luda!)
                When I was 13, I had my first love
                There was nobody that compared to my baby
                And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above
                She had me goin' crazy, oh, I was starstruck
                She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks (woo)
                She made my heart pound
                And skip a beat when I see her in the street and
                At school on the playground
                But I really wanna see her on the weekend
                She knows she got me dazin'
                'Cause she was so amazin'
                And now, my heart is breakin'
                But I just keep on sayin'
                "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
                Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"
                Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
                I thought you'd always be mine, mine
                "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
                Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"
                Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
                I thought you'd always be mine, mine
                I'm gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
                Now, I'm all gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
                Now, I'm all gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
                Now, I'm all gone (gone, gone, gone)
